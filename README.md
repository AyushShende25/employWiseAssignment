## Installation & Running the Project

## Assumptions & Considerations
- The application uses [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) as a dummy API.
- Since Reqres.in doesnâ€™t persist changes, updates wonâ€™t be reflected after a page reload.
- React Query is used for caching and refetching data after updates.
